# EasyTouch - Virtual Mouse 👉🖱

EasyTouch is a virtual mouse application built with Python, utilizing the power of convex hull algorithm and libraries such as Mediapipe, PyAutoGUI, and OpenCV. With EasyTouch, you can control your computer's cursor and perform various mouse functions using simple hand gestures captured by your webcam. 👋✨

## Features

- ✨ *Virtual Mouse Control*: Move your hand in front of the camera to control the cursor on your computer screen. Perform left-click, right-click, scroll, and drag-and-drop operations effortlessly.

- 🧲 *Convex Hull Algorithm*: EasyTouch leverages the Convex Hull algorithm to accurately detect your hand's position and shape, ensuring precise and responsive mouse control.

- 🤚 *Intuitive Gestures*: By using predefined hand gestures, you can trigger various mouse actions. The application recognizes gestures for left-click, right-click, scroll, drag-and-drop, and more.

- 🔄 *Easy Integration*: The application is built using Python and relies on popular libraries such as Mediapipe, PyAutoGUI, and OpenCV. You can easily incorporate EasyTouch into your existing Python projects or extend its functionality to meet your requirements.

## Requirements

Before running EasyTouch, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- 🐍 Python (version 3.x)
- 🧪 Mediapipe
- 🤖 PyAutoGUI
- 🖥 OpenCV

## How It Works

EasyTouch utilizes the power of computer vision and machine learning to detect and track your hand movements. It processes the video feed from your webcam, applies the Convex Hull algorithm to identify your hand's contour, and maps it to the screen coordinates. This mapping allows you to control the cursor with your hand movements.

The application recognizes predefined hand gestures based on the positions of your fingers and triggers the corresponding mouse actions accordingly.
